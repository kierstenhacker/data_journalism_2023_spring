This notebook will contain the code needed to execute our data analysis project and answer the questions we would like to ask of the Spotify and YouTube data from Kaggle.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Load the libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(tidytext)
library(rvest)
library(scales)
```

### Load and clean data
```{r}
spotify_youtube <- read_csv("data/Spotify_Youtube.csv") %>%
clean_names() %>%
rename(number = x1) %>%
  select(-c(number)) %>%
mutate(duration_secs = duration_ms/1000, duration_mins = duration_ms/60000)

glimpse(spotify_youtube)
```

### Basic exploratory analysis
** The dataset has 20,718 rows and 28 columns. There are some NA values within the YouTube data which could serve as a limitation. Similarly, within the YouTube description values, some of the descriptions have emojis or other characters and symbols that could be difficult to work with. Another limitation could arise with the values in the instrumentalness column since they include negative exponents which could also be difficult to work with for different analysis calculations. The original source of the data defines the columns well, otherwise we may make them more complicated. Since the data includes artists whose music is on Spotify but probably not every artist in the world, we would not be able to make assumptions about the music industry as a whole. Another limitation we can notice is that some of the songs that fall under an artist's most popular songs are feautres of said artist on another song. This can be kind of confusing, but we might be able to work around it using filters once we start more analysis. However, this data is also helpful for answering our question about how collaborations affect an artist's popularity. One code we would need to make note of is 'key,' which denotes pitch notation but we need to find a way to make it easily apparent what the pitch is rather than just seeing a number. There could also be issues with repeat songs when songs are on more than one album, although sometimes it will be the same song but a slightly different rendition.

##Questions

**Question 1: Which attributes, such as danceability, energy, loudness, etc., tend to have a correlation with the most streamed songs?**

**Analysis**: After using code to select the variables we wanted to work with, we found the correlation coefficient for each song attribute in relation to the number of streams for each song. After finding the correlation coefficients, we calculated the mean among the coefficients for each attribute to average it out. After that, we looked for the maximum value among all the means, and found that danceability and streams had the highest positive correlation coefficient of about 0.073. There were some previous errors due to some values being NA, but using the filter for complete cases got rid of them, and the data we did use was so large that it provided a general idea of which attribute had the greatest correlation to number of streams. Previously, we analyzed the correlation between attributes and the streams of ALL songs, rather than doing so for the highest streamed songs. Using our previous method, we found danceability had the highest correlation, but only with a correlation coefficient of about 0.07. After using code to select the top 100 streamed songs, we selected the variables we wanted to work with, we found the correlation coefficient for each song attribute in relation to the number of streams for each song. After finding the correlation coefficients, we calculated the mean among the coefficients for each attribute to average it out. After that, we looked for the maximum value among all the means, and found that acousticness and streams had the highest positive correlation coefficient of about 0.218. There were some previous errors due to some values being NA, but using the filter for complete cases got rid of them, and the data we did use was so large that it provided a general idea of which attribute had the greatest correlation to number of streams. 

Both forms of analysis made us want to plot the top 50 songs by danceability and acousticness to see which ones seemed to be more consistent with our statistical findings. Acousticness has some peaks among the top 50, but overall, danceability seems to be consistently higher. Although acousticness has the highest correlation relative to other factors, it is too difficult to tell which attribute has the highest correlation while also being significant. If anything, the most newsworthy finding about this question may be about diversity when it comes to music taste, quality and popularity. 

```{r}
attribute_correlate_stream <- spotify_youtube %>% 
  select(danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, stream) %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%

##Find the correlation coefficient between each attribute and number of Spotify streams 
   mutate(
    dance_cor = cor(danceability, stream),
    energy_cor = cor(energy, stream),
    key_cor = cor(key, stream),
    speech_cor = cor(speechiness, stream),
    acoustic_cor = cor(acousticness, stream),
    instrumental_cor = cor(instrumentalness, stream),
    live_cor = cor(liveness, stream),
    valence_cor = cor(valence, stream),
    tempo_cor = cor(tempo, stream)
  ) %>% 

##Find the mean correlation coefficient for each attribute
  summarise(
    mean_dance_cor = mean(dance_cor),
    mean_energy_cor = mean(energy_cor),
    mean_key_cor = mean(key_cor),
    mean_speech_cor = mean(speech_cor),
    mean_acoustic_cor = mean(acoustic_cor),
    mean_instrumental_cor = mean(instrumental_cor),
    mean_live_cor = mean(live_cor),
    mean_valence_cor = mean(valence_cor),
    mean_tempo_cor = mean(tempo_cor)
  )

##Output the highest value among the mean coefficients
max_value <- apply(attribute_correlate_stream, 1, max)

**Question 2: Does higher engagement on YouTube videos lead to more streams of the song from the video on Spotify? Is there a relationship that exists between social engagement and streams?**

**Analysis**: In order to find and map out the correlation between Youtube video views and Spotify streams, we first grouped the data by artist and then summarised the data by the sum of views and sum of streams for each artist. After that, we plotted the data into a scatter plot with a line of best fit, which shows that there is a slight positive correlation between number of views on YouTube and number of streams on Spotify. This means that it can be generally true that as one value increases, so does the other. While doing this, we divided the totals by 1,000,000 because the numbers would have been to large to easily grasp. We found that for the most part, songs that did well on Spotify tended to do well on YouTube, except for some outliers that either had a higher number of Spotify streams than YouTube views or a higher number of YouTube views than Spotify streams. For example, Maroon 5's lyric video from the studio recording of a performance on The Voice only had 26 views on YouTube but 1,004,576,500 streams on Spotify. Conversely, Kyla's HRVY Official Video had 326,427,602	on YouTube and only 24,160 streams on Spotify. 	 

```{r}
##Code to find the total number of views and streams (divided by 1,000,000 because numbers were too large to work with)
streams_views <- spotify_youtube %>% 
  select(artist, track, stream, views) %>% 
  mutate(difference = abs(stream-views)) %>% 
  group_by(artist) %>% 
  summarise(
    total_views = sum(views)/1000000,
    total_streams = sum(stream)/1000000,
  )

##Create a scatterplot with line of best fit
streams_views %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=total_streams, y=total_views))+
  geom_point(size=2)+
  theme_minimal()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  labs(
    title = "Correlation between an artist's Spotify Streams and YouTube Views",
    x = "Number of Streams on Spotify",
    y = "Number of Views on YouTube"
  )

##What was happening when that positive relationship wasn't the case, who was successful on Spotify and then not YouTube and vice versa?
spotify_youtube %>%
  filter(stream > 10000, views < 5000) %>%
  group_by(artist) %>%
  arrange(desc(stream))

##We had to use 100000 streams since there were little no results with a smaller number of streams
spotify_youtube %>%
  filter(views > 10000, stream < 100000) %>%
  group_by(artist) %>%
  arrange(desc(views))

missing_vals <- spotify_youtube %>% 
  filter()
```

**Question 3: How many videos with a high number of streams are coming from licensed content?**

**Analysis**: Most videos on YouTube with views over 500 million are coming from licensed content. However, we found that there are some outliers. About 54 videos were unlicensed and 15 channels posted unlicensed videos that were also classified as the official video for the track. Perhaps what is more interesting is that accounts that claim to be official for major artists have posted unlicensed videos. Some channels say they are official, like Major Lazer Official or officialpsy, yet their videos are unlicensed and have amassed billions of views. Are these channels truly official? How can they get away with posting these unlicensed videos for such big songs? This question may not be answered with the data, but perhaps contacting a source related to law in the music industry might give us more insight. Bad Bunny is another especially interesting case as one of the world's most famous stars, yet a lot of his videos are unlicensed. There is no one consistent theme or trend between the channels that have posted unlicensed content, though it seems like some of them are from countries outside of the U.S. or rappers and DJs. REDBOX Entertainment also posted unlicensed videos, but it is not the movie company. Rather, after a quick YouTube search, we found that it is a channel for a music production company with 2.27 million subscribers that posts YouTube videos from mostly foreign artists. It seems like some channels are definitely repurposing content from an unverified user, like WORLDSTARHIPHOP or perhaps other content is remixes or live performances in the case of DJs. In doing pivot wider, we can filter for licensed and unlicensed content as well as official videos and view the total number of views for each sorted by channel. A lot more unlicensed content came from videos with less than 500 million views on accounts that were not official or recognizable names, like white noise for babies for example.  

```{r}

**Question 4: How do collaborations or features on a song affect its popularity on Spotify and YouTube? What are the most popular collaborations?**

**Analysis**: Some artists definitely seem to be more successful with their songs that have collaborators on the track compared to songs where they are the sole artist. We were trying to do a similar analysis to the question above using pivot_wider to compare the number of streams for songs with a collaborator and without so we could see which artists would be best to collaborate with if you want your song to reach the most people. We ran into an error trying to use pivot wider in the end, so we will definitely need to brainstorm more solutions that will move us past this dead end before we complete more analysis. Either way, Post Malone is the only artist who had streams in the top 10 for both a single song and a collaboration. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis were also in the top 10 highest number of streams for their collaborative songs, but fall behind for single songs. Also, we noticed a complication with the data when doing an analysis like this to answer the question because songs will appear twice under the different artists' names even though it is the same song. This can be seen especially with Macklemore and Ryan Lewis since the song appears under Macklemore, Ryan Lewis and Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. Industry Baby and Levitating also appear twice, once under each artist's name, throwing off the top 10 most streamed collaborative songs. Also, Macklemore only has collaborative songs as part of the data, so we cannot compare any songs he may have by himself as an artist to contrast success. After visualizing the artists with the top 10 collaborative songs and the top 10 songs without a feature, it is still a bit difficult to determine who benefits the most from collaborative tracks. For example, some of the tracks that are listed without "feat.," which we used to filter, are actually collaborative songs so it is hard to make judgements. Halsey and The Chainsmokers "Closer" is listed twice, once under each artist, as a solo song. So is "Sunflower" for Post Malone and Swae Lee. When comparing average streams for 11 popular artists between solo and collaborative songs, it was not necessarily clear which artist is best to work with if you want your songs to get more streams. Macklemore had the same average number of streams since he does not have any solo songs in the data. But for other artists, some had more success alone rather than others and the reverse is also true. Nicki Minaj had 364,889,147 more streams for her songs with collaborations than her solo music. Camila Cabello, Halsey, Justin Bieber, Lil Nas X and Post Malone, had higher average streams for songs that featured another artist compared to their solo tracks. 

```{r}
##Filtering to create a new dataframe that only includes songs that have one or more artists featured on the track including the main artist
song_features <- spotify_youtube %>%
  filter(str_detect(track, 'feat.'))

##Sorting through the dataframe to find the artist who has the highest number of streams with a collaborator on their track

##Filtering for tracks where there are no collaborators and grouping it by artist in the order of highest streams to lowest
spotify_youtube %>%
  group_by(artist) %>%
  filter(!str_detect(track,'feat.')) %>%

##Attempting to use pivot_wider to compare the amount of streams for tracks with collaborators and tracks without. It returns each song as a column, making it difficult to read.

  arrange(desc(stream))

##Finding average streams for artists by themselves and with collaborators to see the benefits
collab_average_streams <- spotify_youtube %>%
  filter(artist == "Camila Cabello" | artist == "Lil Nas X" | artist == "Post Malone" | artist == "Dua Lipa" | artist == "Ed Sheeran" | artist == "Drake" | artist == "Halsey" | artist =="Swae Lee" | artist == "Justin Bieber" | artist =="Nicki Minaj" | artist == "Macklemore", str_detect(track,'feat.')) %>%
 group_by(artist) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_stream_collab = mean(stream)
  )

non_collab_average_streams <- spotify_youtube %>%
  filter(artist == "Camila Cabello" | artist == "Lil Nas X" | artist == "Post Malone" | artist == "Dua Lipa" | artist == "Ed Sheeran" | artist == "Drake" | artist == "Halsey" | artist =="Swae Lee" | artist == "Justin Bieber" | artist == "Nicki Minaj" | artist == "Macklemore") %>%

  summarise(
    mean_stream_non_collab = mean(stream)
  )
```

##I played around with unique words for the descriptions of YouTube videos but then decided to ditch my efforts because they weren't really that relevant to any major newsworthy findings.

```{r}
spotify_youtube_text <- spotify_youtube %>%
  mutate(text = description)

unique_words <- spotify_youtube_text %>% select(text) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

unique_words %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(25) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) 
```

**Question 5: Do singles or songs from full albums get more streams? What about views on YouTube? Which artists have more success with singles compared to full albums and vice versa?**

**Analysis**: More well known American artists were in the top 10 highest views for YouTube videos coming from songs that were part of a full album. A lot of the singles were also songs that had collaborations between artists. None of the artists who had the top number of streams for singles also had the top number of streams for songs on a full album. Perhaps collaborative songs also perform better when they are a single rather than featured in an album. The highest number of streams for a song that came from an album was The Weeknd's "Blinding Lights" which had about a billion more streams than Halsey's "Closer" which is the top single with the most amount of streams. The top videos with the highest views for singles and regular album tracks were also much different than the results from the Spotify streams in these categories. What this could tell us is that maybe jsut because a song is popular does not mean the video to go with it will be as well. There are deeper visual aspects and social trends that may contribute more to the number of views on YouTube.  

```{r}
##Filtering for singles and arranging them from highest number of streams to lowest

**Our most newsworthy finding from milestone 4**
So far, we think our most newsworthy piece of analysis comes from either the licensed and unlicensed content on YouTube or the analysis of artist collaborations. We think that once we are able to complete more analysis on artist collaborations, it would make for a really interesting article about who to feature on your track if you want your song to amass a lot of streams on Spotify. From what we have seen, there have not been any articles with a central focus along the lines of "Here's who to make songs with if you want them to take off," which we think could be an impactful finding in and around the music community. Also, with the consumption of video on the rise between TikTok and YouTube, we think it is newsworthy to question why certain channels have unlicensed content or how their videos can be official but unlicensed. As we learn more about how to navigate social media spaces in terms of regulating content and copyright, perhaps these findings can provide more insight for those who make social media rules or who work for the social media companies and are trying to limit unlicensed content. 

**Final memo**
With the rise of video sharing on social media, we found that some well-known artists publish unlicensed content of their music on YouTube, and occasionally those unlicensed videos are also listed as the official video for the track. Major Lazer, Bad Bunny, Psy and the Bee Gees were just a few of the artists whose content amassed millions or even billions of views on YouTube while being unlicensed. This finding can bleed into interesting legal issues or even stories about how these artists or channels are able to get away with posting unlicensed official videos. Most readers likely have any experience with legal matters regarding the music industry or even copyright infringement in general, so an explainer of social media practices and laws associated with the music industry could be helpful alongside the data evidence. After working with the data, we also learned that there are attributes that can be taken into consideration when it comes to the popularity of songs or artists. Similarly, we were able to compare the success of artists’ solo music and their collaborative music. While we were not able to find a clear answer of who is the best artist to collaborate with if you want your song to be a hit, we were able to find that some very popular artists get a much bigger boost from collaborative work rather than solo work. Overall, there is a fairly positive correlation between streams on Spotify and views on YouTube, but there are a few outliers where that relationship is not the case, which could also be interesting to look into further. Although the data represents the top 10 streamed songs for various artists on Spotify, the data is not a good measure or representation of the artist as a whole, nor does it allow us to make assumptions or judgments about the music industry as a whole. There is a difference between an artist who only has 10 songs that all appear on this top-streamed list compared with an artist that may have 100 songs. What about the other songs? Perhaps the songs that appear on this list are just bumps in popularity compared to their overall discography. The data also does not take the release date into consideration. Songs that were released a long time ago are more likely to be streamed more often over time compared to newer songs. Perhaps the data could be restructured by release date to give a better understanding of how music and streaming change over time, rather than just being a slight profile of an artist. It would also be more useful if the data was restructured to include more than 10 songs per artist and if it were to include another column for collaborative songs that featured all of the artists’ names rather than just listing it in the track name. A weakness of the data that we ran into was that collaborative songs were listed many times, often once per artist. And sometimes, collaborative songs were listed once under each artist but did not include “feat.” in the track name which signals an artist feature. Some strengths of the data, however, were that it did not need much cleaning and it was sort of organized in half making the columns easy to follow between Spotify data and YouTube data when they were addressing similar content. To report the story further, it would be helpful to try and obtain updated data as new songs are released every day and streams/views are constantly increasing. It would also be great to obtain more data for an even wider number of songs since there are so many produced in order to get a better picture of the whole world of music. To gain a deeper understanding of the legal aspect of music and find some anecdotal nuggets to weave in with the numerical evidence, we should start by contacting experts in law or top music executives. Then, we could also try to get statements from different artists’ public relations teams to see if those who post unlicensed content on YouTube are aware of it, and if they are, why they do so. We could relate the story to readers by discussing some of their big, beloved pop stars but also by addressing licensing issues for everyday social media users like them. This is where legal experts, smaller artists or even more data regarding licensing for videos unrelated to music could come into play.
