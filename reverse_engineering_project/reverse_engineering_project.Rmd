## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

**The code below will work to answer the analysis posed in this sentence from the Washington Post article about fatal police shootings of women since 2015. "About 31 percent, or 77, of the 247 women fatally shot by police since 2015 had mental health issues, compared to 22 percent of the 5,362 men killed."**

**The code below will work to answer the analysis posed in this sentence from the Washington Post article about fatal police shootings of women since 2015. "Twenty of the 247 women were killed in that kind of situation, analysis shows. In 12 of those 20 shootings, police said the women killed were caught in crossfire or shot accidentally."**

"Since 2015, police have killed 26 unarmed women, including Taylor. Of those, 14 were White, seven were Black, four were Hispanic and oneâ€™s race was unknown. While about twice as many White women were shot and killed as Black women, White women account for five times the Black female population."**
